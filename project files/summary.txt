Game Setup:

The game board is a 3x3 grid, represented by 9 div elements with the class "cell".
Two players take turns, starting with "X" and alternating with "O".
The game state is tracked using an array called options.


Gameplay:

Players click on empty cells to make their move.
The current player's symbol ("X" or "O") is displayed in the clicked cell.
After each move, the game checks for a winner or a draw.


Win Conditions:

There are 8 possible win conditions (3 rows, 3 columns, 2 diagonals).
If a player gets 3 of their symbols in a line, they win.


Game Flow:

The game starts with player "X".
Players alternate turns until there's a winner or a draw.
The game status is displayed, showing whose turn it is or the game result.


Game End:

If a player wins, the game displays "[Winner] wins!".
If all cells are filled without a winner, the game declares a "Draw!".
A "Restart" button allows players to start a new game.


User Interface:

The game has a simple HTML structure with a title, game board, status text, and restart button.
CSS is used to style the game board and cells.



The JavaScript code handles the game logic, including initializing the game, processing player moves, checking for a winner, and managing the game state.
